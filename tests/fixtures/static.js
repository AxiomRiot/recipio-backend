  ingredients: [
    "2 pounds pork ribs or pork neck bones (900g)",
    "1 cup re-hydrated seaweed/kelp (optional)",
    "1 pound lotus root (450g)",
    "4 slices ginger",
    "1 tablespoon dried goji berries (optional)",
    "12 cups cold water",
    "salt (to taste)",
    "1 scallion (finely chopped)"
  ],
  steps: [
    "Soak the pork ribs or neck bonesÂ in cold water for an hour. Then rinse thoroughly, drain, and set aside. Boil a large pot of water, and add the pork bones to blanch. Once the water is boiling again, let it cook for 1 more minute. Turn off the heat, drain, and wash the pork bones clean. This process will give you a really clear (rather than cloudy) soup.",
    "If you want to include seaweed, you can buy dried seaweed (kelp/kombu) or rehydrated seaweed at your Asian supermarket. Just try to avoid seaweed \"knots,\" as they tend to be a bit sandy. It takes at least 3 hours to rehydrate dried seaweed, so you can soak it the night before. Once soaked, simply wash the seaweed in a basin of water until the water is completely clear. Then drain, and it's ready to add to the pot.",
    "Right before you're ready to start the soup, peel the lotus root and cut it into large chunks (If you do this too early, the lotus root will oxidize, similar to a potato. So hold off until you're about to start cooking).",
    "To start the soup, add all the prepared ingredients to a stock pot: the (blanched) pork, seaweed, lotus root, ginger, goji berries and cold water. Bring it to boil, and then immediately turn it to down to a slow simmer. Cover and let it simmer for at least 4 hours...the longer the better. Reheating it the next day will make it even more flavorful. Add salt to taste, and serve with chopped scallion on top."
